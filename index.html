    <p>Our 'home' is the UK and experiencing the joys and wonders of nature.  We enjoy travelling and finding hidden gems in the English countryside.   
        We have both had our own pets in previous years.  This includes dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, birds, a snake, and a rabbit.  
        So we are no strangers to looking after a wide variety of animals that have their own personalities, off-the-wall quirks, specified feeding plans (defrosting mice is no problem), 
        and daily routines.  We will ensure that our routine is in perfect harmony with those of your pet(s). We're kind, considerate, easy-going, 
        and believe in 'live and let live' where others are concerned.
    </p>
     <p>We will treat your home and your 'babies' as our own and ensure that they are happy and content whilst you are on your travels. 
        Having the reassurance that your pet is being loved and well taken care of will add to the relaxation and enjoyment during 
        your time away. As we are located in Sheffield, which is central to the UK, we are well placed to undertake sits anywhere in the UK.  
        <strong>We would appreciate a contribution towards the cost of travelling.</strong> 
    </p>
    <p> We will treat your property with respect and ensure that is cleaned and well looked after whilst you are away.  You will return to a well-presented and clean home.  It will feel like we have never been there.  
        We appreciate the trust that you will have placed us with in regard to looking after your precious animal(s) and home.  
        Your trust will not be misplaced.
    </p>
    <p>Neither of us has any disabilities, we are both non-smokers and we have no pets.

<h3>Reviews</h3>
<h4>Alexis - Haywards Heath England</h4>
<p>Ruellyn and Mark are a lovely couple, incredibly friendly yet utterly professional and with great attention to detail. They stayed with us the night before we left for our trip and it was a real pleasure getting to know them a little. I felt fully confident leaving them to look after our home and animals. Ruellyn was very thorough and great at keeping in touch while we were away, sending regular photos and updates. Our cockapoo was very well loved and cared for, as were our cat and two hens. The house was left neat, clean and tidy - could not have asked for more and would love to have them sit for us again. I would not hesitate to recommend them as house sitters.</p>
